                                Steven and Mary Pecksen are always my first choice for house and dog sitters. No one else is even a close second. Why? They care!
                                <br><br>
                                They have cared for my quirky French Bulldog many times over the last four years. They lavish her with great walks, lots of cuddles, and only the food/treats she needs.
                                <br><br>
                                They care about my home, always leaving it as clean (if not cleaner) than it was when I left. They care enough to send regular updates whilst independently problem solving to avoid interrupting valuable family time.
                                <br><br>
                                My advice... book this dynamic duo early to avoid disappointment.

                                One of the things we appreciate most is how they keep us updated throughout the stay. They always send pictures, which gives us extra peace of mind and is such a thoughtful touch. It's clear they genuinely care about the pets they look after.
                                <br><br>
                                On top of that, our house is always spotless when we return. It's such a great feeling to come home to a clean space and a happy dog.

                                We have always had regular messages and photos, which gives us great peace of mind when far away. They have been quick to react to any dietary issues that Otto has occasionally. Otto absolutely adores them - he cries with excitement every time they reunite! Steven and his wife, Mary, also care for our home impeccably. We trust them completely and will continue to use their amazing service.

                                Not only do we know that our dog is in good hands thanks to their picture updates, but we always come home to a spotless house, where the laundry is done and fresh linens are on the bed! It's magical. (They've even left us baked goods!)
                                <br><br>
                                Communicating with Steven and Mary is incredibly easy, and this sets them apart. When we first met, they noted all the details about our dog and house, and this has made for very smooth vacations and efficient arrivals/departures.
                                <br><br>
                                We are grateful for their diligent and reliable service, and selfishly we wish we could keep them all to ourselves.
                                <br><br>
                                We have used dozens of dog sitters, and Steven and Mary are simply the best! No one agrees more than our dog, and that speaks volumes.

                                Steven and Mary took the time to understand Kirby's needs and routines, going above and beyond with regular updates and a calm, intuitive approach that made all the difference for our sometimes anxious dog. Every time we come home, Kirby is happy, relaxed, and clearly well-loved—he literally jumps into their arms whenever he sees them, a true testament to the bond they've built and the gift of knowing he's in good hands when we're away.
